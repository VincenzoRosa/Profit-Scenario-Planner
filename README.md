## üìä Calculation Logic

### Business Health Score (0-100)
```
health_score = (
  revenue_growth_score * 0.3 +
  profit_margin_score * 0.3 +
  cash_reserve_score * 0.2 +
  inventory_turnover_score * 0.2
)
```

### Base tROAS Calculation
- **Health Score > 80**: Aggressive (tROAS 2.0)
- **Health Score > 60**: Balanced (tROAS 3.0)
- **Health Score > 40**: Conservative (tROAS 4.0)
- **Health Score ‚â§ 40**: Defensive (tROAS 5.0)

### Context Adjustments
- **Seasonal**: High season (-0.5), Low season (+0.5)
- **Competition**: High competition with good health (-0.3)
- **Growth Stage**: Growth stage with good cash reserves (-0.4)
